## Package Installation 

Since unity doesn't support git dependencies in package.json you have to [install UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx#upm-package) manually. 

Edit manifest.json file in your Unity Packages directory 


```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.gbros.blog.unirx.messagebroker": "https://github.com/GbrosGames/Blog.git?path=Assets/UniRx/MessageBroker",
    "com.neuecc.unirx": "https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx.git?path=Assets/Plugins/UniRx/Scripts"
}
```

Or install via url
